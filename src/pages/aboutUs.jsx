                    <h2>FOUNDER'S WORD</h2>
                    <p>Reflecting on my entrepreneurial journey, I express a desire to have connected with mentors earlier in my life. Consequently, I established the Amali Mentorship Network. “Amali,” derived from the Arabic word “amal,” meaning hope, embodies the network’s mission to support women entrepreneurs. My goal is to guide them in taking the necessary steps toward successful self-employment, enabling them to reclaim their rights and freedoms while improving their livelihoods. Ultimately, this initiative contributes to the flourishing of families, the prosperity of communities, and the growth of economies. </p>
